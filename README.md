**LRU Cache**

:green_heart: A data structure that returns **Least Recently Used** items:

Let me explain with examples and some hand made diagrams :smiley:

Servers basically provides service in form of data to us (we are clients to a server). Basically we request our server to fetch details and if server
has that detail, it will provide us with a big smile :blush:. But think :open_mouth: how many request will be at server at every point of time, as you can imagine 
with world's population and user of Internet.

Now suppose it have only one memory from where it is fetching details to us, so eventually it will take a lot of time to complete our requests.

So to solve this problem servers have two type of memory :-

**1. Cache Memory**

**2. Disk Storage**
